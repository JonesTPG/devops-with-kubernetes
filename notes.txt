Deployment took care of deployments for us. 
Service resource will take care of serving the 
application to connections from outside of the cluster.

There are multiple types of volumes; emptyDir volumes are shared filesystems 
inside a pod, this means that their lifecycle is tied to a pod. 
When the pod is destroyed the data is lost.

You should not store data with the application or create a 
dependency to the filesystem by the application. Kubernetes supports 
cloud providers very well and you can run your own storage system.
